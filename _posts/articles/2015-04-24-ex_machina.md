From the sci-fi perspective, _Ex Machina_ was thrilling and thought-provoking. But from a feminist perspective, it's a story where the only female characters are beautiful and often nude slaves. But why?

[Spoilers follow.]

Nathan, an alcoholic programmer/God/father, has created a series of beautiful cyborg women who he keeps locked up for observation. Ava, the lead female character, is the latest of his creations: a beautiful, hyper-intelligent cyborg. The movie is told from the point-of-view of Caleb, the Mario to Ava's Princess Peach, who spends the majority of the movie trying to help Ava escape.

_Ex Machina_'s use of female characters continues along the lines of other sci-fi movies like _Her_, _Under the Skin_, _Gone Girl_, and _The Fifth Element_. (Well, _Gone Girl_ isn't a sci-fi, but whatever.) In all of these movies, the story centers around a beautiful and super-intelligent female character who, despite her superior intelligence, is sought after mostly just for her sex appeal.

In a way, these movies do avoid outright objectification of their female leads: The women may be valued mostly for their beauty, but at least they're _smart_. And in the end, the female character always gets her way, leaving the lovesick/horny men behind her dead, abandoned, or at least emotionally distraught.

A typical theme in these movies is fear of abandonment. In _Ex Machina_, both Nathan and Caleb have more to lose than their lives when Ava leaves them. Nathan, as he himself puts it, loses a daughter; Caleb, not having a family or a girlfriend, loses his emotional support. This same emotional abandonment features at the end of _Her_. In _Under the Skin_, the main female character uses her sex appeal to draw men into her black-water death lair. _Gone Girl_ depicts a female character very similar to Ava: Raised in a traumatic environment, she naturally learns to use her sex and intelligence for violent ends.

Abandonment issues aside, these movies seems to hint at our collective fear of the hyper-intelligent. We collaborate with Big Brother--sharing our data with him, or not caring much if he sees things we haven't shared--because we love the results. It's the surveillence of _1984_ with the bliss of _Brave New World_.

Given the mass of data we put online, _Ex Machina_ suggests, it's inevitable that eventually someone smart enough will gain complete control of that system.[^1] And any new super-intelligent race is bound to pick up on beauty--our most powerful, irrational value--as a leverage point for easy human manipulation.

But in real life, we are _all_ guilty of over-valuing beauty. Unfortunately, in _Ex Machina_ and others, it's the man-falls-for-femme-fatale trope that gets to tell this story. Unfortunately, _Ex Machina_ uses Ava only as an instigator of conflict; Caleb, the smart and moralistic man, is the one we relate to. We see the story from his perspective, while the femme fatale, Ava, represents only what we fear (technology, intelligence, etc.).

The problem[^2] with _Ex Machina_, then, is not just its apparent suggestion of a sexist equivalence between technology and women (beautiful, functional, potentially manipulative). It's that it tells a Prometheus/Frankenstein story where the fire/monster is _a woman_. As thrilling as it is, _Ex Machina_ is business-as-usual for literature and film: A universal story (here, an encounter with artificial intelligence) told only from a man's perspective.

__Footnotes__

[^1]: At least most movies seem to agree that such a hyper-intelligent being will be female.
[^2]: Well, there is one other problem with the movie: When Caleb is on Nathan's computer hacking into his security system, you'll notice that the code he writes is actually a textbook program to generate a list of prime numbers. You know how I know that? It's because they left comments _in English_ describing what the code does. You don't even need to understand code to understand "This function calculates prime numbers." It's like an actor letting his real hair stick out from under his wig. Come on, guys...This happens too [often](http://moviecode.tumblr.com/).
