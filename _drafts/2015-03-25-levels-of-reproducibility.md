## Data available upon request

## There are levels of reproducibility: can't you just choose at least one please? 

Surely there is at least _some_ aspect of the code or data that you can share online. Once you've published it, at least.

Given that scientific articles are more like advertisements than recipes, we need supplementary material online. And, ideally, we'd like as much of your scientific process to be transparent as possible. But there are levels of tranparency, scales of reproducibility. To reduce our problem to that of _computational_ reproducibility, that is, to be able to start with the data and get through the models and out the other side with some figures, I think is a good first step.

And with your precious data, now published in at least one paper, isn't there at least _something_ you can share with us? At least post the data you used to generate your figures, for example.

But, wait, what's the point of this? Are we really worried people are faking figure generation? There's probably more bad science going on at the level of model fitting--not at the figure generating stage.
