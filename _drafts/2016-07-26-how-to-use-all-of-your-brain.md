You've probably heard the myth that, as humans, we only use 10% of our brain. True or not, I find it interesting that this is assumed to be a bad thing.

Forget about neurons for the moment and think instead about muscles. What percent of your muscles do you use to butter a piece of toast? If I told you that I used 100% of my muscles to butter toast, would you think that was a good thing? No: that would be inefficient. And with neurons it's the same thing.

But if we only need 10% of our brain most of the time, shouldn't that mean we should be able to use the remaining 90% for something else?

To return to the muscles of toast-making, let's say I ask you to also wash the dishes while you butter the toast. You only use 10% of your muscles to butter the toast, so that should leave plenty aside for doing the dishes, right? Wrong: both washing the dishes and buttering the toast requires using two hands, and you only have two hands total.

So the real issue here--with brains or muscles--is degrees-of-freedom, not capacity. You may be limited by how much of your brain or muscles you can use because certain parts are required for everything you do. So buttering the toast might require only 10% of your muscles overall, but it's going to require all of your hands (and your eyes: to watch where you're buttering).

Likewise, in the brain, it's not about how much you're using. It's about the efficiency with which you use particular parts.
