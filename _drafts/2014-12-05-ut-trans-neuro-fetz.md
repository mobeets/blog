Eberhard Fetz, the one who in 1969 or something found that a monkey could modulate the activity of a _single cell_, if reward was conditional on the activity of that cell.

In this talk, Fetz proposes a closed-loop paradigm for brain-machine interfaces, in which you record from one area, stimulate another (stimulation downstream?). The talk consists of many example applications.

The most interesting part of the hour-long talk, to me, was the less-scientific last fifteen minutes or so. He speculates that _any_ type of cell can be used in this paradigm, not just those in motor cortex as is typically done. Specifically, he continues, you must pick cells for which the organism has _volitional_ control, i.e., top-down control, cognitive control, whatever. (Aside: Andrew Tan says some study modeling Fetz's data found that _spontaneous activity_ is the critical ingredient for this being true. Fetz says Yeah maybe, but you definitely want volitional control. Andrew says nothing in response.)

The killer experiment, Fetz says, is to use this paradigm to find evidence that the brain can use temporal coding. He mentions how temporal coding's rival, rate coding, has won in sensory and motor cortex. But what about association cortex? Language areas? Maybe you can set up recurrent loop such that the organism can generate particular temporal spiking patterns.

Next, speculating even further (this is when I got into it), suppose you could get the brain to utilize the computational power of these brain-machine interfaces. Think about how much we love our little smart phones, he says. Our brains share something with computers in their informational capacities, even if they might use fundamentally different architectures. But we've learned to interact and use these machines via standard learning, with sensory and motor feedback. Meaning we tap and swipe and see and read to interact. But imagine if the brain could learn to use the computer but _bypassing_ the sensory and motor stuff, interfacing directly via electrodes. (Could a brain learn to use a NAND or NOR gate? What happens if it does?) "This is science fiction, by the way," he clarifies.

Finally, he mentions a recent [_Science_ article](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6197/668.figures-only) about [some IBM thing](http://www.wired.com/2014/08/ibm-unveils-a-brain-like-chip-with-4000-processor-cores/) that implements a more biological computing architecture that supposedly performs  human-like tasks like pattern recognition better than does the traditional von Neumann architecture. (He claims that we now know the brain doesn't use the von Neumann architecture. I seem to remember Dennett basing a lot of analogies between mind and machine in _Understanding Consciousness_ on the von Neumann architecture, so I'm interested to see exactly how mind and machine have been shown to differ.)
