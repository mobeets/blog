This week in neuroscience...Well-known monkey researcher Logothetis announces after weeks (months?) of pressure from animal-rights activists that his lab will cease using monkeys in research. What looks like a victory from the public side of things really came more from a failure of public research institutions to come to his aide in the controversy. A little bit too late, a letter of support from a German institution that initially distanced itself from the controversy ("We don't even have monkeys," they said), and a call for "solidarity" amongst other monkey researchers from Peter Thiel.

The controversy arose from a documentary showing apparent monkey discontent and maltreatment, taken in secret from the lab via a rogue PhD student, and aired nationally on German television. Logothetis and coworkers were since subjected to hate speech, threats, etc...

As usually tends to happen in these situations, someone gets called out and takes all the hate on their own. (See the guy who got his car blown up, and razor blades infected with AIDS sent to him in the mail. No charges were pressed, evidently.)

So what's the issue? Personally, I've never been able to come to a concrete decision as to the ethics of using rhesus macaques in research, despite having worked in a lab doing such research (though not doing it myself, personally, I am at the very least guilty-by-association, or guilty-by-using-the-data-from-the-monkeys) over the last six or so years. But only this week have I heard things that at least give me some comfort, however much they may side-step the original question as to whether or not it is legal to keep monkeys in cages, surgically open their brains to install implants, and occasionally strap them to a chair and record from their neurons while they do some sort of task for water, on a water-restricted diet so as to keep them motivated to perform the task well.

Here are the claims:

Well, what's the part that really bothers you? For myself it's the housing. It is small, and it is indoors. And, in fact, this is the sight that initialized my moral confusion, as well as perpetuated it: Seeing our lab's monkeys each in his/her respective "home", a tiny cage as big as a large dog's kennel, with nothing to do inside but stare out of it. The surgeries, the recordings? That doesn't bother me so much; it's not so bad. But the housing is sad, and there's no way around it.
But anyway, why are you picking on the use of monkeys in research? Labs who work with monkeys use the same monkey for as long as possible; most have less than ten, and work with only these monkeys for a decade or so. Monkeys are expensive, after all! The real problem...[The side step:] when someone works with mice or rats, those guys are killing them daily. Walk into work, grab a mouse, do stuff to him (anything you want!), and then at the end of the day you kill him. How many mice does one kill, exactly? Tons. And rats are smart, and sociable. People keep them as pets for a reason, after all. No one's going to keep a rhesus macaque for a pet because it'd probably attack you.

Like I said, this isn't to say that experimenting on monkeys is obviously morally-defensible. There are many gray patches, and I am far from resolved on the subject. But I have been helped by the news event this week to start thinking some more about this issue.

The most common argument I'd heard previously was that we need to record neurons from something close to human, and it's clear that in many ways, the mouse brain is nothing at all like the human brain. How'd we invent those awesome neural prosthetics, like the cochlear implant, and the neurally-controlled robotic arm? Monkey work. The usual reply is that we could record from neurons noninvasively using things like fMRI and Ecog, but from the statistical perspective, given that neural data is at root a series of discrete spiking events, recording directly from individual neurons is always going to provide richer data, and thus a chance at a more fundamental understanding of how the brain works, which, after all, is at the root of the reason why most people study the brain. And if understanding how the human brain works is what you're after, be it for clinical reasons or not, working with a species whose brain is fairly similar to a human's (i.e., monkeys, not mice or rats) is certainly ideal.

I've been told to read some Peter Singer.
